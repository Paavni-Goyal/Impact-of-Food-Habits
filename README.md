# 🥗 Exploratory Data Analysis on Food Habits

This repository contains an insightful Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset related to food habits, dietary patterns, and lifestyle choices. The analysis was performed using Python with the primary objective of uncovering trends, correlations, and behavioral insights from the survey data collected.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Domain**: Health & Lifestyle
- **Focus**: Understand food consumption habits, meal patterns, awareness of healthy eating, and demographic-based trends.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files

- `EDA_Python_on_FoodHabits.ipynb` – The main Jupyter Notebook with data analysis and visualizations.
- `FoodHabits_Report.docx` – A Word report with detailed questions and data-backed answers summarizing key findings from the dashboard.

## 🧪 Analysis Performed

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Univariate and bivariate visualizations
- Frequency analysis (e.g., junk food, breakfast skipping)
- Segmentation by age, gender, and occupation
- Insights into beverage preferences and reading food labels

## 🔍 Insights Explored

1. What is the most represented age group among respondents?
2. How frequently do people consume junk food?
3. Is there a noticeable difference in food habits based on gender?
4. Do people tend to skip breakfast?
5. What is the overall attitude towards healthy food?
6. Are nutritional labels read by consumers?
7. What impact does occupation have on food choices?
8. Which beverages are most popular?
9. When do people typically snack on unhealthy items?
10. Are there any regional differences in food behavior?

_All these are discussed in detail in the report and supported with visual insights._

## 📊 Visualizations

The notebook includes the following:

- Count plots
- Pie charts
- Histograms
- Bar plots grouped by demographic variables
- Insights highlighted using colors and legends
